/**
 * Sum Calculator
 * Write a class with the name SimpleCalculator. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with
 * names firstNumber and secondNumber both of type double.
 * Write the following methods (instance methods):
 * ● Method named getFirstNumber without any parameters, it needs to return the value of the
 * firstNumber field.
 * ● Method named getSecondNumber without any parameters, it needs to return the value of
 * the secondNumber field.
 * ● Method named setFirstNumber with one parameter of type double, it needs to set the value
 * of the firstNumber field.
 * ● *Method named setSecondNumber with one parameter of type double, it needs to set the
 * value of the secondNumber field.
 * ● Method named getAdditionResult without any parameters, it needs to return the result of
 * adding the field values of firstNumber and secondNumber.
 * ● Method named getSubtractionResult without any parameters, it needs to return the result of
 * subtracting the field values of the secondNumber from the firstNumber.
 * ● Method named getMultiplicationResult without any parameters, it needs to return the result
 * of multiplying the field values of firstNumber and secondNumber.
 * ● Method named getDivisionResult without any parameters, it needs to return the result of
 * dividing the field values of firstNumber by the secondNumber. In case the value of
 * secondNumber is 0 then return 0.
